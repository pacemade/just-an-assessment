Zipped without the node_modules folder as instructed

Is a React App:

run `npm install`

run `npm start` to start it up!


Notes:
Tried finishing up as much as I could, ran out of time/hit a block when faced with the task of adding tags.

Was thinking along the lines of getting student.js to update the state: persons within App.js.

Was able to pass some information through, but could not figure out how to select the particular student, go into the object and make the update. Thought about using the id as a selector, but ran out of available time.
